Do you... do you like it? I hope it meets your expectations!" RecieveJackpot="I'm really proud of this one!" NotEnoughIgd="I'd love to help, but you don't have all of the materials.

  <Message MaidID="11000771" npc="모밍" SelectItem="This, right?" CraftRequest="No sweat." CraftCancel="Are you intentionally giving me a hard time?" RecieveItem="It's done."

You can obtain $item:40100001$ from Supply Merchants in major towns, $item:40100023$ by dismantling Lv. 20 and above equipment, and the rest by hunting monsters." Expired="My contract expired.

RecieveItem="Is this what you requested?" RecieveJackpot="I think I made this one extra good. Or, did I? " NotEnoughIgd="How am I supposed to do that when you don't have all the materials? You can get $item:40100001$ from the Supply Merchant in major towns, $item:40100023$ by dismantling Lv. 20 or higher equipment, and the rest by hunting monsters... Okay?"
